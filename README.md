# Motion-Matching-For-Gotdot

A module for [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) implementing basic motion matching.  
Followed the inspirational [Learned Motion Matching](https://theorangeduck.com/media/uploads/other_stuff/Learned_Motion_Matching.pdf) including inertialization for animation blending and layered AABB for speeding up search process.
